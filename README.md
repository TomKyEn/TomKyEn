- 👋 Hi, I’m <strong> @TomKyEn </strong> - Not looking for a job. I'm an older guy, currently a podcast producer for three Labor Unions and their cloud administrator. I'm a fiction writer(unpublished, so far), former singer in two local rock bands, rock guitarist-ish, actor, PC Tech, but I've only dabbled with code before now. 
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Learning something new that I hope will support my dreams, ideas, talents, skills, and allow me to gain more power to effectively direct my future.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Front End - HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, SQL, - I want to learn as much useful and practicle info as possible as quickly as possible so I can put it to use. I'm working to learn the basic concepts of design and functionality before I delve to deep into the rest. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...Nothing yet. I want to find out what I can accomplish on my own before I reach out to collaborate. I intend to be working on some websites that will hopefully help me reach my goals and grow into a profitable venture, so that owuld tend to place the starting period of any collaborations in the first quarter of 2022 at the eariest, or so I'd imagine.
- 📫 How to reach me ... coder@tochco.com
